# Composite
Composite pattern is used when application needs to manipulate a hierarchical collection of "primitive" and "composite" objects. 
Processing of a primitive object is handled one way, and processing of a composite object is handled differently. 
Having to query the "type" of each object before attempting to process it is not desirable.
